This first exercise does not contain any programming. You first have to
install a few things. But don't worry, we use a very simple setup in this
course. I recently found a book that I really really like and where I wish
that I have had such a book when I learned programming. If you are an
autodidact you can basically just work on this excellent book. However I still
recommend you doing my course because I will try to give you more insights on

* why we are doing this
* what programming is good for
* teach from the perspective of a scientist
* try to give interesting examples
* provide more exercises and also feedback on your solutions

So, let's start:

1. Read the introduction of [learn python the hard way][1], I really like the
attitude of the guy on how we learn things.

2. Do the [first exercise of LPTHW][2] which helps you setting up your system
   for the more interesting stuff we start doing in the first lecture. In this
   exercise you learn how to setup your system, install a good editor and how
   to navigate through your filesystem on the command-line (the geeky way of
   using a computer).

3. Install `ipython` by writing the following on your command-line:

    `pip install ipython`

after installation you can use it as you learned in Step 2, by just writing
the name of the application on the command-line.

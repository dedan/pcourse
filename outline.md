Remark on the script
--------------------

In the lectures folder I provide text that can be seen as a script to the
lecture. But it is not complete. I will go along this script during the 
lecture, but it cannot be seen as a complete reference. It contains examples
and summarizes what we learned in the end of each lecture. But I still expect
the people who take the class to read other stuff. All the details of a
programming languages don't make sense to be written down in a script or book.
They change and they are boring to read. If you are not sure about something,
just google it. Forgot the syntax of a python *for loop*?
Type `python for loop` in google. Forgot how to do string formatting in 
python? Type `python string formatting` in google. 


lec0: Before we really start
----------------------------

* read intro from learn python the hard way
    * on motivation and best practice
    * on setup up a environment
* install ipython


lec 1: very basics
------------------

* variables
* read input
* control structures
    * decisions (`if`)
    * repetitions (`for`, `while`)


lec 2: basics again
-------------------

* comment on return values
* more on loops (iterators)
* random access to list elements
* string formatting



options for next classes
------------------------

I also need examples of all this stuff. The course should always show why
something new is cool and useful.

Show a nice example of how to do a lot with little code in each lecture

* more on files (reading and writing)
* dictionaries (data structures)
* list slicing
* list comprehensions
* important modules
    * math, datetime, time, re, glob, os, os.path, shutil, json, random
    * berghain bouncer with random module
* more exercises with truth values
* variable unpacking (wichtig für enumerate)



ich könnte anfangen eine einfache todo anwendung zu schreiben, dafür braucht man aber file operationen für die serialisierung

modules
-------

this is something you would learn very late in another course. But I want to show you how simply it is to already do really cool stuff with a few lines of code. And as I said in one of the first lectures: programming helps to solve boring and repetitive tasks. Another important things is to not do work that other people have done before and maybe even better then you could. Python comes with loads of functionality that you can use to solve your own problems. We have to distinguish between 2 things:

* the *python language* which is easy to learn because it has only a small set of keywords like `for`, `if`, `while`, etc..
* hundreds and hundreds *python modules* which contain python code that other people wrote for you.
